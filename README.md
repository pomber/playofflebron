# Building a web scraper to get regular season vs playoff stats from basketballreference.com

**Aim:** 
To learn about using Python to write a web scraping script, likely using the BeautifulSoup library.

**Use:** 
Will use the script to get a more complete nba player statistical dataset from the website basketballreference.com -- primarily, I would like both the REGULAR SEASON stats and the PLAYOFF stats. The resulting dataset needs to be separable on this criteria for each player/season.
